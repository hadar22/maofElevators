The system is a 3-tier web application (browser,application server, data server)<br />
Server-side: NodeJs, express (The only one that communicates directly with the MySQL database. <br />
Client-side: React <br /> 
Database: MySQL, Firebase <br />

(I used the axios library which allows making HTTP requests in an easy and pleasant way.) <br />
